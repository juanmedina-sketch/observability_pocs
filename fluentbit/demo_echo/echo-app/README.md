## Demo Bank Account API. 

The Banck Account API is a very small and simple excersice where we implemented 
some basic endpoints modeling a Bank Account. 


#####  The actions you can call on this API are
- Create an Account
- Close an Open account 
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Get the balance
- Transfer money between open accounts

##### Objective:
 Implement the missing parts of the App and get the test suit running. 

-----

There is a Testsuit in AccountApi.spec.js and you can run it with `npm run test `
or only run an specific test with: `node_modules/.bin/jest AccountApi.spec.js -t 'test name' --runInBand `
